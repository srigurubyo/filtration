We offer Filter Pads in two categories namely Cellulose Pulp and Carbon Activated and their details can be found under respective link.  Cellulose Pulp category of Filter Pad comes with varied specification to suite the final filtering process deployed at the plant.

We manufacture a wide range of filter papers & pads on a very highly sophisticated production plant. The entire process of manufacturing is untouched by hand from the pulping stage to the finished product. This is a high precision completely automatic plant which ensures a uniformly produced filter media for excellent purity and frees from external contaminants qualities vital for sensitive industries like drugs, pharmaceuticals, foods, beverages, chemicals, cosmetics etc.

Our raw material is continuously monitored for quality control. Constant laboratory tests are conducted to check filtration efficiency, pad porosity, absorbency, Filtration speed and bursting factor. The fibers of our filter paper & pads are also subjected to a special porous chemically inert wet-strength impregnation process to impart very high mechanical strength while filtering aqueous.

We also manufacture handmade filter papers & pads as per customerâ€™s requirement. We use pure Cellulose Fiber, Cotton-Linter Pulp in manufacturing Quality filter Papers.

The different kinds of Filter Pads and their technical specifications are listed in below table:
